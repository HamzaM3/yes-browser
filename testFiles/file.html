          The 1909 Giro d'Italia was the inaugural running of the Giro d'Italia,
          organized and sponsored by the newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport. The
          event began in Milan on 13 May with a 397 km (247 mi) first stage to
          Bologna, finishing back in Milan on 30 May after a final stage of 206
          km (128 mi) and a total distance covered of 2,447.9 km (1,521 mi). The
          race was won by the Italian rider Luigi Ganna of the Atala team, with
          fellow Italians Carlo Galetti and Giovanni Rossignoli coming in second
          and third respectively.

          Conceived by La Gazzetta to boost its circulation at the expense of
          its rival Corriere della Sera, the 1909 Giro was the first stage road
          race. Its eight stages, although relatively few compared to modern
          Grand Tours, were each much longer than those raced today. The event
          began with a long primarily flat stage that was won by Dario Beni. He
          lost the lead after the next stage to the eventual winner Luigi Ganna,
          who in turn lost it to Carlo Galetti after the mountainous third
          stage. Ganna regained the lead after the fourth stage and successfully
          defended it all the way to the finish in Milan, winning three stages
          en route. Atala won the team classification.

        <h>Origin</h>
        <p>
          The idea of holding a bicycle race around Italy was first suggested in
          a telegram sent by Tullo Margagni, editor of La Gazzetta dello Sport,
          to the paper's owner Emilio Costamagna and cycling editor Armando
          Cougnet.[1][2][3] La Gazzetta's rival, Corriere della Sera was
          planning to hold a bicycle race of its own, flushed with the success
          of its automobile race.[2][3][4] Morgagni decided to try and hold the
          race before Corriere della Sera could hold theirs, and following La
          Gazzetta's success in creating the Giro di Lombardia and Milan–San
          Remo, Costamagna decided to back the idea.[3][5] The inaugural Giro
          d'Italia bicycle race was announced on 7 August 1908 in the first page
          of that day's edition of La Gazzetta,[4] to be held in May 1909.[4]
          The idea of the race was influenced by the success of the French
          magazine L'Auto's organization of the Tour de France.[5]

          Since the newspaper lacked the necessary 25,000 lire to sponsor the
          race,[2] the organizers consulted Primo Bongrani, a sympathetic
          accountant at the bank Cassa di Risparmio. He proceeded to solicit
          donations from all over Italy,[3] and succeeded in raising sufficient
          money to cover the operating costs.[3] The prize money came from a
          casino in San Remo after Francesco Sghirla, a former Gazzetta
          employee, encouraged them to contribute to the race.[2][3] Even
          Corriere, La Gazzetta's rival, donated 3,000 lire.[2]
